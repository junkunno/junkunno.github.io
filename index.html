										<h1><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Visit Jamaica</strong></span></h1>
											<p>A dive into visitor data regarding passenger arrivals to Jamica for the year 2016:</p>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Who was coming?</strong></li>
												<li><strong>Why?</strong></li>
												<li><strong>Where from? Etc.,</strong></li>
											</ul>

											<h2>Why this project?</h2>

											<p>Just sheer curiosity about the information that was available. My history running a bed &amp;
											breakfast for the past few years, you start to notice certain trends about the visitors. 
											While I had a few obvious confirmations, it was still surprisingly, a bit of an eye-opener after analyzing the raw information.</p>

											<h2><strong>Summary of The Data Source:</strong></h2>

											<p>The source of the travel data came from&nbsp;<a href="https://data.gov.jm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jamaica Open Data</a>, 
												a public data repository provided by the Jamaican government from the various ministries that includes a variety of data from 
												traffic to health. The most recent travel data available on this platform was for the year 2016.</p>

											<ul>
												<li>
												Actual data was collected from embarkation/disembarkation cards (immigration forms) all air 
													passengers are required to fill out on arrival.
												</li>
												<li>
												N.B.: Jamaican nationals who reside overseas are included in the numbers.
												</li>
												<li>
												Cruise passengers flying into the island to meet the cruise ship are not included in tourist arrival figures unless they 
													spend at least one night in a land-based accommodation.
												</li>
												<li>
												The file is a CSV file.
												</li>
											</ul>

											<h2><strong>Summary of Data Cleaning:</strong></h2>

											<ul>
												<li>
												The CSV file was imported into Excel
												</li>
												<li>
												Adjusted &amp; formatted data:

												<ul>
													<li>
													changed header titles for clarification
													</li>
													<li>
													confirmed correct data types
													</li>
													<li>
													remove some abbreviations &amp; replaced with full word
													</li>
												</ul>
												</li>
												<li>
												Removed Duplicated (47)
												</li>
												<li>
												Removed spaces (trim())
												</li>
												<li>
												Corrected misspellings
												</li>
												<li>
												Performed preliminary analysis: complete &amp; accurate
												</li>
											</ul>

											<h2><strong>Analysis in Excel:</strong></h2>

											<p>After data cleaning was finished analysis was performed using excel where several pivot tables were created to see a clearer picture 
												of the information at hand. I wanted to get a clearer picture of the type of visitor that was coming to the island.&nbsp;</p>

											<ul>
												<li>Though I had a fairly confident understanding about what countires visited Jamaica the most, I was indeed surprised at the
													 sheer number of Americans that <em>&#39;touched down&#39; </em>as we would say. In addition, the sheer number of overall visitors
													  that came to Jamiaca for vacation <em>(1.4 mil)</em>, it reinforces how critical our tourism industry is to the overall economy.&nbsp;</li>
												<li>I also had no idea of the enormous number of passengers that passed through Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay.
													 *If that airport can move so many people through that quickly maybe they can help out their sister airport in Kingston&nbsp;ðŸ‘Ž.</li>
												<li>Outside of<em> &#39;vacation&#39; </em>for reason for travel, another interesting standout was the second largest group of visitors
													 coming to Jamiaca strictly for<em> &#39;sport&#39;</em>. With the vast majority travelling through Kingston airport. In fact, 
													 the number 1 reason for travel to Kingston is for <em>&#39;sport&#39;!</em>&nbsp;I though the month of March would be an outlier 
													 with the numbers, since our very famous annual athletics <strong><u>
														<a href="https://worldathletics.org/news/feature/boys-girls-champs-jamaica-zharnel-hughes-issa">CHAMPS</a></u></strong> competition is held in March.
														 However, the findings are that visitors are arriving fairly steadily throughout the year for this reason.&nbsp;</li>
											</ul>

									 see my <a href="https://github.com/junkunno/Jamaica-Travel-Data">GitHub</a>!</strong>&nbsp;</p>

								

									<h2><strong>Conclusions:</strong></h2>

									<ul>
										<li>
										No surprise that the &#39;Big Three&#39; (US, Canada, UK) dominate the visitor numbers, however the United States far
											 eclipsed even the other two countries by more than double their amounts!
										</li>
										<li>
										The Cayman Islands travel numbers were also surprising. With a population of only 67,000,
											 to be Jamaica&#39;s number 4 in total visitors I don&#39;t think anyone could have guessed.
										</li>
										<li>
										IT&#39;S A VIBE ðŸ¥³! VACATION is the number 1 reason people come to Jamaica (no real surprise there).
										</li>
									</ul>

							

									<h2><strong>Recommendations:</strong></h2>

									<ul>
										<li>
										Jamaica&#39;s tourism product is very precious &amp; helps to drive the country&#39;s economy. 
											It would be beneficial for the government to encourage travel to the island targeting other
											 markets/countries outside of the Big Three.
										</li>
										<li>
										In addition, it might also be beneficial to encourage travel to the island for reasons 
											other than vacationing, such as for business &amp; sport (which the country dominates globally 
											when it comes to track &amp; field).
										</li>
									</ul>

									Well that&#39;s my little project about visitor data to Jamaica. I hope it was interesting and eye-opening!<br>

									Thanks for having a look!<br>
